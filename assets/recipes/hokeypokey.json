Stir frequently until the sugar is dissolved and mixture comes to a boil (this will take some time, don't turn up the heat above medium to speed up the process or you could ruin your candy).\n\n4.  02:12  Once mixture begins to boil, attach your candy thermometer (make sure the tip of the thermometer is not touching the bottom of the pan) and don\u2019t stir any longer.\nWithout stirring, cook to 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C). \n\n5.  03:01  Once mixture reaches temperature (it will still be clear at this point, it is supposed to be), immediately remove from heat and stir in your baking soda (heads-up!
